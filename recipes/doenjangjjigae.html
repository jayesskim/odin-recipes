                <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
                <li>4 large shrimp, shelled, deveined, washed, and coarsely chopped (about ⅓ cup)</li>
                <li>2½ cups water</li>
                <li>7 dried anchovies, guts removed</li>
                <li>5 tablespoons fermented soybean paste (doenjang)</li>
                <li>6 ounces medium-firm tofu, cut into ½-inch cubes (about 1 cup)</li>
                <li>2 green onions, chopped</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine the potato, onion, zucchini, chili pepper, garlic, and shrimp in a 1½-quart (6 cups) earthenware pot or other heavy pot.</li>
                <li>Wrap the dried anchovies in cheesecloth (or a dashi bag, a pouch for stock-making sold at a Korean grocery store), and put them into the pot with other ingredients  Add water and cover.</li>
                <li>Cook over medium-high heat for 15 minutes until it starts boiling. If you use a stainless steel pot, it will take less than 15 minutes, about 7 to 8 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in the soybean paste, mixing well. Cover and cook for 20 minutes longer over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Add the tofu and cook for another 3 minutes. Remove the anchovy pouch and discard.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle with the green onions and serve as a side dish to rice. Serve it directly from the pot, or transfer to a serving bowl. Everybody can eat together out of the pot, or portions can be ladled out in individual bowls for each person.</li>
            </ol>
