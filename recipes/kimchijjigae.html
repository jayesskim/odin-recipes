        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>For added flavor, save the water used to rinse rice, ssal ddeum mul, and use for the jjigae/stew. The water used to rinse rice is commonly used for Korean jjigae. Use the water from the second or third round of rinsing. Another option is to use anchovy broth (about 7 or 8 medium dry anchovies and one 3-inch square dried kelp boiled in 3 cups of water for 10 minutes).</p>
